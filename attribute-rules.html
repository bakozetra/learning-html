      <h2>
        Do not do this
      </h2>
      &lt;a&gt;href=https://www.onja.com&gt;  This example is the bad .Why is it bad?The value has not  quotation with the URL.We suggest,Try to remember  these . Attribute value must have quotes(<q></q>).
    <p>
        <h2>
      Do it instead
      </h2>
      &lt;a&gt; href="https://www.onja.com"&gt;This example is  good to apply because it helps   to be a good  at coder .Before we have told  that  we have to put   quote   for the attribute value.
