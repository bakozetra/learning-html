        <h2>About the nesting rules</h2>
        <p>Opening tag and closing tag is nesting 's rules
            Why is it relevant to remember ?If you create a document and use an html ,you must follow these structur
            because it help you to become a good at coding. accoding that definition you have to follow these rules:
        </p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We should use a lowercase for the element name because a lowercase word is a term which describes a
                    collection of HTML elements
                </li>
                <li>
                    The element we need to put on element <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> are:
                        TITLE (required)
                        SCRIPT, STYLE
                        CDATA
                        ISINDEX, BASE, META, LINK (empty)
                        OBJECT (see content model below)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Define a doctype at the top
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can't have end tag without a start tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every start tag needs to start with this symbol "<" and ending of ">" </li>
                <li>
                    Every end tag needs to start with this symbol "</" and ending ">" </li>
                <li>
                    We can't have <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> as child of <code>&lt;lu&gt;</code> only valid tags to put inside an<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>  is an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.
                </li>


                <li>
                    we can't put body inside head because head tags don't belong inside of body tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Element <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> not allowed as child of element body in this context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A document must not include more than one visible main element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The main element must not appear as a descendant of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.

                <li>
                    We can
                    have<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;address&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;area&gt;</code>
                    if it is a descendant of a map element)
                    </l>
                <li>
                    We can use this element <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> Contexts in which this element can be used:
                    Inside <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> elements.

                    </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        <P>
            <h1>
                Do not do this
            </h1>
       
      
            Don't do this example because element ul not allowed as child of element
            ol in this context.
            Contexts in which element ul may be used where flow content is expected.
            Content model for element ol zero or more li and
            script-supporting(Script-supporting elements are those that do not represent anything themselves ) elements.

        </P>
        <p>
            <h1>Do this</h1>
            Try to remember these rules .We should not put a more than one element in <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.We have to
            use <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> as children with this element.
