    <h2>What is html</h2>
    <p> <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. It allows the user to create and structure sections,
      paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.</p>
    <p>HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead,
      it makes it possible to organisation and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
